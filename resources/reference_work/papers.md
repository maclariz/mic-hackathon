## Papers

Denoising approach we plan to use: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads2688

Geometric flow: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-024-01428-x

Paper that data is from: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41563-025-02138-5

Plan is to use a fusion of the methodology from first and second papers, and apply it to the data from the third paper.

## Data 

Sean Collins' data: https://archive.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/1371/

We can also potentially use the data from these 2 UoM papers if we run into problems with Sean's data:
-  twisted interfaces - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-0682-9
-  nanoparticles in liquid cell - https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04713
